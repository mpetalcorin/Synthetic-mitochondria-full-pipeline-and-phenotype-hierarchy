# Synthetic-mitochondria-full-pipeline-and-phenotype-hierarchy
Welcome to the synthetic mitochondria project. This notebook shows how we can model, simulate, and redesign mitochondria using computational biology and synthetic design tools.

This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for designing, modeling, and analyzing **synthetic mitochondria**, with a focus on **phenotype hierarchy** and synthetic biological engineering. The Jupyter notebook presents a structured workflow combining **molecular design**, **phenotypic outcome mapping**, and **simulation** strategies to explore mitochondrial bioengineering.

## Project Overview

Synthetic mitochondria represent a frontier in synthetic biology, with potential applications in:
- **Precision bioenergetics**
- **Cellular rejuvenation**
- **Mitochondrial disease therapy**
- **Artificial cell design**

This project demonstrates a **full pipeline** from design principles to phenotype-level analysis using a stepwise notebook-based workflow.

### Key Features
- Modular workflow for synthetic mitochondria construction
- Phenotype hierarchy mapping based on molecular design
- Support for modeling ATP production, membrane potential, and ROS
- Discussion of synthetic circuits and metabolic behavior
- Reusable code blocks for bioinformatics and system simulation
